# AI Context Constitution

This repository contains a **general-purpose AI Context Constitution** — a concise, human-first framework for working with AI systems without creating cognitive debt or surrendering creative autonomy.

Think of it as **Asimov’s Laws of Robotics**, but for **human–AI collaboration**.

---

## What this is

The **AI Context Constitution** defines non-negotiable principles that govern how AI should assist humans:
- AI accelerates thinking, it does not replace it
- Human intent always comes first
- Cognitive shortcuts are treated as risk, not efficiency

It is intentionally short, strict, and readable by both humans and LLMs.

---

## What this is not

- Not a productivity hack
- Not an AI prompt collection
- Not a corporate ethics document
- Not model-specific

This is a **foundational layer**, meant to sit above tools, workflows, and agents.

## Structure of this repository

```
/
├─ AI_Context_Constitution.md   # The General Constitution (core laws)
├─ README.md                   # This file
├─ /variants                    # Domain-specific adaptations (optional)
│   ├─ developer.md
│   └─ artist.md
├─ /docs                        # Explanations and rationale
│   ├─ cognitive-debt.md
│   └─ design-rationale.md
```

- **AI_Context_Constitution.md** is the only normative document
- Everything else is explanatory or adaptive

---

## How to use

1. Read the Constitution fully
2. Apply it as a *pre-context* for AI tools or agents
3. Fork and adapt for your own domain (developer, artist, studio, etc.)
4. Do not expand the Constitution — create variants instead

## Core idea

> **Brain → AI → Brain**

Human intent initiates.
AI executes.
Human judgment closes the loop.

Breaking this loop creates **Cognitive Debt**.
